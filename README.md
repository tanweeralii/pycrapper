A simple web scrapper in python to get the current trending hashtags on twitter. Since web-scrapping through BeautifulSoup doesn't work on twitter web-page, so this the manually scrapped data from twitter.

## Installation
1. $ git clone https://github.com/tanweeralii/pyScrapper
2. $ cd pyScrapper
3. $ pip install -r requirements.txt
4. $ python3 main.py
